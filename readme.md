# Slick's Slices

A site for a fictional pizza joint, created with Gatsby & Sanity as part of the [Master Gatsby](https://mastergatsby.com/) course by Wes Bos. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a deep dive into the Gatsby framework.

The site makes use of serverless AWS Lambda functions hosted via Netlify. [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) is used on the backend as a headless CMS so that data can be modified as required, which results in the site being rebuilt and redeployed using webhooks.
